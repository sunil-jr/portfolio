          As a proficient Java Developer, I have acquired a deep understanding
          of Java programming language and its various tools and frameworks.
          With years of experience in Java development, I have honed my skills
          to deliver high-quality software applications, ranging from simple to
          complex systems.

          Bulk-SMS Microservice API Integration: As part of my professional
          engagements, I successfully built and integrated a Bulk-SMS
          microservice API into an existing HMIS system. The integration of this
          microservice enhanced the capabilities of the system, allowing users
          to send text messages to multiple recipients simultaneously, thus
          saving time and effort.

          Development of Android Application for Tuberculosis Care: One of my
          notable accomplishments was the creation of an Android application
          that catered to tuberculosis care. The application incorporated
          automated data synchronization in the presence of an internet
          connection and a QR-based ID scan, which enabled faster and more
          accurate data collection, analysis, and management.

          HMIS Upgrade under Ministry of Health and Population Guidelines: In
          line with the Ministry of Health and Population's 2078 guidelines, I
          upgraded an entire Health Management Information System (HMIS) using
          my technical skills and knowledge. This upgrade included upgrading the
          Java version from Java 8 to Java 17, and the Spring Framework version
          to the latest version available. The upgrade enhanced the system's
          performance, reliability, and scalability, ensuring its compliance
          with the regulatory requirements.

          Expertise in Spring Framework-based Applications: Over the years, I
          have worked extensively on several Spring Framework-based applications
          such as ICMS, PMIS, PIS, SAMYANTRA, and many more. My experience in
          working with these applications has enabled me to leverage the
          framework's features and functionalities to develop robust, scalable,
          and maintainable software applications.
